# Crop Disease Detection

Agriculture, the lifeblood of human civilization, faces significant challenges from crop diseases. These diseases inflict devastating consequences, leading to economic losses, reduced food production, and jeopardized food security. Farmers desperately need accurate and rapid disease identification to mitigate these risks. Traditional methods of disease identification, often relying on visual inspections by experts, are plagued by limitations: Time-consuming, Labor-intensive, and Limited accuracy.
To overcome these limitations, deep learning-based crop disease detection using an ensemble approach is implemented. This solution leverages the power of artificial intelligence to automate and significantly improve disease identification. 
Deep learning excels at image recognition and pattern detection, making it ideal for analyzing plant leaves. By harnessing this technology in an ensemble approach, we combine the strengths of multiple deep learning models to achieve even greater accuracy and robustness.
